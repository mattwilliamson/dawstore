dawstore - Django App Engine Simple Storage

This is a simple Django App Engine App with three calls--Put, Get and Delete to store, retrieve and delete files.


Get Started
===========
Check out the code.
Create a new app engine app.
Edit app.yaml to include your app name.
Upload to app engine.
Create a superuser.
Navigate to /admin and create a new File->Account.


UPLOAD
======
Uploading a file is as simple as the following:

<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="http://YOURAPP.appspot.com/file/put/PUBLIC_KEY/SECRET_KEY/" method="post">
	<input type="file" name="myfile" />
	<input type="submit" />
</form>

Once it is uploaded it will return a key to be used later.

You can use a file that's been uploaded like so (FILE_KEY was returned when you uploaded):
